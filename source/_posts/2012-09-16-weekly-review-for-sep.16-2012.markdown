I think now I can only do this review twice a week.


No efficiency for the last two weeks, and I have left many things undone. Mainly because I always got a headache on the weekends, and can not do any job in front of a computer. I think I have not sleep well these two weeks, I need to adjust my body clock back normal...

###Things I have done for the last two weeks:

####Life:

- [ ] see friends

####Hack
