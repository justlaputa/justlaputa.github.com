Recently I started to use Sublime Text as my main editor. I want to write something about my first experience of it.

I'm an Emacs user and I love Emacs. The direct reason that I switch to Sublime Text is this slides I read: [Front-end Tooling Workflows](https://speakerdeck.com/addyosmani/front-end-tooling-workflows). Yet I have been thinking about it long ago, some other reasons are:

- Emacs does not look cool in Mac OSX, and I always use Sublime Text at home, and Emacs at office
- Sublime has good UI and yet still very simple and fast!
- Nowadays, more and more front js plugins are developed for Sublime Text, but it is always hard to config them in Emacs

If you are a front end developer, I recommend you to try sublime, I don't want to start another editor war, but try to find the best thing for your work is never bad.

Now I'll share my first experience of Sublime Text, hope it helps other developers.

### General

#### Installation

The latest version is [Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3), it is in Beta, but quite stable to use, and now most major plugins already support Sublime Text 3, so it is recommend to use this version.

#### Documents

Here is the official document site: [Sublime Text 3 Doc](http://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/), yet it is too simple. There is also an unofficial doc site, which is also recommended by the official doc: [Unofficial Doc](http://docs.sublimetext.info/en/latest/index.html).

Now you don't have to read the doc, the editor is quite simple and straight to use, you can refer to the doc when you want some help.

#### Most used shortcuts

Actually, you can find all functions from the menubar, but it is helpful to use some shortcut to save the time.

`Cmd + Shift + P(mac)/Ctrl + Shift + P(win,linux)`: Command prompt, it shows a global prompt and you can type any command, it will search throught all avaliable commands.

`Package Control`: after you open the command prompt, type *package ins*, it will fuzzy search and match the `Package Control: Install Package` command, type *Enter* then you can type any package to install. It is quite simple and fast to install any package you want.
