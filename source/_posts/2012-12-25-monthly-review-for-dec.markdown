I checked that my last review is in September, so I guess this should be a 3-Months Review, but I barely remember what I have done in October and November, I'll try to recall what I have done in this month.

<!--more-->

Jasmine
-------
I have continued to learn [Jasmine](http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/), and also given a [lighting talk](https://speakerdeck.com/justlaputa/lt-jasmine) about it.

Also I have worked on [jasmine-jquery](https://github.com/velesin/jasmine-jquery) and did some [contribution](https://github.com/velesin/jasmine-jquery/pulls/justlaputa?direction=desc&page=1&sort=created&state=closed) to this pretty library.

Testem
-------
When learning [Test'em](https://github.com/airportyh/testem), I started to learn [node.js](http://nodejs.org/). Node.js is awesome, and Test'em really saved my time. I completely switched from [JsTD](https://code.google.com/p/js-test-driver/) to test'em, it's easy to config, fast, supports [RequireJS](https://code.google.com/p/js-test-driver/) elegantly, and very cool. I started to do real [TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) now.

For using it, I also learned something about [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/) and [code coverage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_coverage), and try to write a [lcov](http://ltp.sourceforge.net/test/coverage/lcov.readme.php) reporter for [jasmine](https://github.com/richardbutler/testem-coverage-sandbox/pull/1), it's interesting stuff.

Lighting Talking
-------
Give a [lighting talking](https://speakerdeck.com/justlaputa/scope-and-hoisting-in-javascript) about [scope and hoisting](http://www.adequatelygood.com/2010/2/JavaScript-Scoping-and-Hoisting) in Javascript. The more I learn Javascript, the more I like this [wired](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat) but powerful language.

Movies
------
I watch the movie _[Wreck-It Ralph](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1772341/)_, and as it is already  end of December now, I think this is the best movie I have watched this year.

Trello
-------
I got to know trello maybe 2 months ago, when I read the [post](https://www.blossom.io/blog/2012/09/17/3-tips-for-quick-effective-stand-up-meetings.html) about standup meeting, and learned things about Kanban. But I started to try [Trello](https://trello.com) just resently. Because of this [blog post](http://accidentalhacker.com/post/37883161398/rocking-gtd-with-trello), I haves tried to use Trello to do some GTD work, and it is wonderful. It's clear and simple to use, very good website design, I want to transfer most of my Emacs-Todo-Agenda into Trello Board and tasks, it helps me a lot on GTD.

Last Weekend
-------
Last weekend, I did what I wanted to do long ago.

1. Reinstall my desktop to Windows 7 and wipe Windows 8, I seem not love Win8 that much and I need Win7 to flush my Android.
2. [Flush](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1859714) HTC One X back to stock, thought I might broke my phone, but finally found a [solution](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1658084&nocache=1) to charge my phone on fast boot mode. Thank God for that post, Now I have upgraded to Android 4.1 Jelly Bean with Sense 4. It is Great!
3. Install [Fedora 18 Beta](https://fedoraproject.org/en/get-prerelease), it's much better than I imagine, the installer is beautiful, Gnome 3.6 has much change and I want to use it to replace Ubuntu in my office after it [released](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Schedule) in Jan 8.
4. Hangout with friends and have a long talk in KFCâ€¦

Next
-------
The things I want to do in next month:

1. learn more about node.js
2. learn [mocha](http://visionmedia.github.com/mocha/) and [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/)
3. See friends in Shenzhen at New year holiday, it's just this Saturday, Yeah!
4. Plan my trip to Tokyo, I'm looking forward to this ^ ^
